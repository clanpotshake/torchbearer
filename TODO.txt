- GM mode options screen
-- disable trait limitations
-- conflictless play


- need a character builder page to burn in stock/class selections to be uneditable on the main actor page
-- override createDialog in actor to get class/stock options set, do nature
- represent places as an item, map to contacts/hometown
- add item slots to actor? lists with a matching soft-limit for each body slot

-gm can call for a roll, link in chat message goes to clicking user's version of that item. so each user gets their own skill values used when they click the linked item name
- Gear should be grouped by category
- container items (bags, caches) should have their own sheet visible to all with their contents. drag and drop to actor sheets for easy inventory management

DIALOGS
  ROLL
    preview dice pool size. make the helper static so the dialog can call it to update
    account for successes on 3

SHEETS
  ACTOR
    PLAYER CHARACTER
      SKILLS
        pass/fails are getting saved to the actor, not the item (old data? make a new actor)
      GEAR
        fuck load of repetition around slot names, factor that out
        how to represent containers? should they be their own item type?

            Foundry does not support items within items. And you don't need a module for dragging
            items between actors.
            In HBS you can just have some element that is marked as draggable via defaultOptions
            dragDrop select with data-item-id="{{item.id}}" and it'll drag the item with the id
            from the actor out, and any sheet accepting that will then get a copy of it.
            It's all built-in to foundry for really easy implementation.
        add item button doesn't work
          filter to type=gear
  ITEM
    roll button on owned items in header
